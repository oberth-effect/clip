This is the Cologne Laue Indexation Program or short CLIP

It is a program to index and refine laue exposures. It can do simulations as well
as index and refine from spots and zones marked on a Laue photograph.
Afterward the rotations to obtain a special orientation could be calculated
for arbitary goniometer configurations. The program is written in the
C++ programing language and the cross platform toolkit Qt.
It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS X.

I would like to thank Gregory Tucker for his contributions to the
Multiwire-Import filter.
